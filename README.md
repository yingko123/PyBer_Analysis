# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:<br>

In this project, we will analyize PyBer rideshare data from Janurary to early May of 2019 with Pandas tools.  We will then visulize these data with Matplotlib tools.<br/>

## Results:<br>

Not surprisingly, urban city type has the highest total rides, drivers, and fares, followed by the suburban city type; while rural city type accounts for the least amount of total rides, drivers, and fares. More interestingly, the rural city type saw the highest average fare per ride and rural city drivers on average earn the highest amount of fare. <br>

When we exame the weekly total fare by city type over the first four month of 2019, we do not see any seasonality associated with these data.  Total fare by city type seems to be stable over these four months.<br>

## Summary: <br>
Base on these initial data analysis, we have the following recommendations:<br>

* Since there are more rides than drivers in the Urban city type, we recommend increasing marketing budget in the urban city markets.  We believe this can fully utilize the driver capacity in this type of cities.<br>

* Consider examining the company resources allocating to the rural city markets are proportional to their much smaller revenue contribution to PyBer.  Should PyBer reallocate these resources to markets with higher fare potentials?

* Consider extending this data analysis to full year to see if there is any seasonality by city type.  Alternatively, look for cities with the highest fare growth rate, or largest fares and see if there are any success factors we can apply to other PyBer markets.
